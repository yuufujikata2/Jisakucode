C ENTER   AT_  THE NUMBER OF ATOMIC CENTERS IN THE
C     *        MOLECULAR CLUSTER, INCLUDING THE OUTER SPHERE,
C     *        IF USED. USE AN EVEN NUMBER.
C ENTER   B_   THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BASIS FUNCTION
C     *        COMPONENTS FOR THE FINAL STATE WAVEFUNCTION.IT
C     *        IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF NMS IN THE OUTPUT OF
C     *        MOLSYM FOR THE SYMMETRY OF THE FINAL STATE.
C ENTER   D_   THE NUMBER OF INEQUIVALENT ATOMS IN THE
C     *        CLUSTER, INCLUDING THE OUTER SPHERE,IF USED.
C     *        USE AN EVEN NUMBER.
C ENTER   F_   THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE
C     *        ON THE OUTER SPHERE, IF USED,ONE FOR EACH
C     *        DIFFERENT L IN EACH SPHERE, NECESSERY TO DEFINE
C     *        THE FINAL STATE WAVE FUNCTION, USUALLY DECIDED
C     *        BY LOOKING AT THE MOLSYM OUTPUT FOR THE PARTICULAR
C     *        SYMMETRY USED. ALWAYS COUNT TWICE THOSE ON THE
C     *        ABSORBING ATOM.
C ENTER LTOT_  THE MAXIMUM L VALUE USED PLUS THE NEXT
C     *        MAXIMUM L VALUE PLUS ONE.
C ENTER   N_   THE SIZE OF THE SECULAR DETERMINANT, THAT IS
C     *        THE NUMBER OF BASIS FUNCTIONS USED FOR THE
C     *        FINAL STATE OF THE PARTICULAR SIMMETRY USED, USUALLY
C     *        DECIDED BY LOOKING AT THE MOLSYM OUTPUT.
C ENTER  NB_   THE NUMBER OF BASIS FUNCTION IN THE FINAL
C     *        STATE SYMMETRY THAT ARE ON THE OUTER SPHERE, WHEN USED;
C     *        OTHERWISE ENTER THE NUMBER OF BASIS FUNCTIONS THAT ARE
C     *        CENTERED ON THE ABSORBING ATOM.
C ENTER  NTR_  THE TRUE DIMENSION OF SECULAR DETERMINANT.
C     *        THIS WILL BE #N-#NB IF THE OUTER SPHERE IS USED;
C     *        OTHERWISE IT IS EQUAL TO N.
C ENTER   RD_  THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RADIAL MESH POINTS.
C ENTER LMAX_  THE MAXIMUM L VALUE USED ON ANY SPHERE.
C ENTER  NP_   THE NUMBER OF ENERGY POINTS,
      CHARACTER NSYMBL*6
