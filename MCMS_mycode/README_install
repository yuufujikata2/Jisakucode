I) Extracting files.

% tar zxvf mcms.tgz

This will create a main directory 

 MCMS 

which includes 3 subdirectories with contents obvious from the name:

 Source  Test  Tutorial

II) Compilation.

The Source directory contains source files and executables compiled with
gcc, gfortran on linux ubuntu 14.04. If they don't run on your machine, 
you need to compile the code which requires using both a 
C compiler (default: gcc) and a Fortran compiler (default: gfortran).

go into the Source directory:

% cd MCMS/Source

You will probabily need to edit the makefile according to the following 
two possibilities:

1) you have a Lapack/Blas library installed on your machine.

% cp makefile_lib makefile

edit the  makefile

- set your C-compiler by replacing the word "gcc" (if needed) 
- set your Fortran compiler by replacing "gfortran" (if needed)
- set the library path by replacing the string "/usr/local/lib" (if needed)
 
2) you don't have Lapack/Blas libraries (or you don't find them ...)

% cp makefile_nolib makefile

That's all in this case.

% make

should compile the code and produce the executable "mcms".
In case of errors, you need to modify the makefile and/or debug the code :-(

% make extra

This compiles the 3 auxiliary programs transformhspot, readhspot, instr2xyz.
If you want to "clean up" (remove object files *.o) you may run:

% make clean 

III. Testing the code.

% cd MCMS/Test
% ../Source/mcms > output

Check the various output files against those in ./OUTPUT/
