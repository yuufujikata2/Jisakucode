In order to execute test_sym_exec you need the following files:
a potential file (in potgen format): e.g. xalpha.pot

run the helper programs transformhspot.f and readhspot.c

% transformhspot < xalpha.pot > C_readable.pot
% readhspot C_readable.pot

This generates the input files "instr.dat" (*) and
one pot-file for each inequivalent atom in LMTO format.
These files are named X_01 Y_02 etc where X,Y are the
symbols of the elements.

For checking the structure file you may run
% instr2xyz (without arguments)
This reads "instr.dat" and writes "str.xyz" in XYZ format

edit the main input file "mcms.in"

run the MCMS program

% mcms

NOTES
(*) For checking the "instr.dat" structure file you may run
% instr2xyz (without arguments) 
This produces "str.xyz" which has the common XYZ format
